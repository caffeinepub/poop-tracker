  "summary": "The diff implements reverts across App.tsx, useQueries.ts, Leaderboard.tsx, and AllTimeStandings.tsx as requested. REQ-28 and REQ-29 appear fully addressed. However, REQ-30 and REQ-31 specifically require the lifetime/daily toggle to remain functional, and the reverted Leaderboard.tsx and AllTimeStandings.tsx shown in the diff appear to be lifetime-only with no toggle wiring present.",

      "requirement": "The lifetime/daily toggle must remain intact in Leaderboard.tsx",
      "reason": "The reverted Leaderboard.tsx shown in the diff is titled 'Lifetime Leaderboard' with no toggle state, no isLifetime/isDaily prop or state, and no reference to LeaderboardToggle or daily data. The file summary for Leaderboard.tsx also does not mention a toggle. The lifetime/daily toggle does not appear to be present in the reverted component.",
