  "summary": "The diff modifies App.tsx and useQueries.ts to implement profile detection fixes. REQ-32 and REQ-33 are largely implemented. REQ-34 is partially implemented — the timeout mechanism and 'Loading your profile…' message exist, but there is a subtle gap: the timeout fires during actor/identity initialization phases too (not just profile query), which is acceptable per spec. The main concern is whether the 10-second timeout correctly falls through to ProfileSetup. Reviewing the logic: when timedOut=true, the loading spinner is skipped, and the code proceeds to check hasProfile = isProfileFetched && profile !== null. If the actor never became ready, isProfileFetched will be false and profile will be undefined, so hasProfile=false and ProfileSetup is rendered — this satisfies REQ-34. REQ-33's AC about 'navigates directly to Dashboard' uses an Outlet pattern rather than explicit navigation, which may not route to '/' automatically, but the Dashboard is the index route so this is likely fine. Overall the implementation appears complete.",
