  "summary": "Both REQ-26 and REQ-27 appear to be implemented. App.tsx introduces the explicit tri-state ('loading'/'has-profile'/'no-profile'), defers routing until actor readiness and profile query completion, shows a full-screen loading indicator, and only routes to ProfileSetup when definitively 'no-profile'. useQueries.ts rewrites useMyProfile with strict gating conditions that prevent premature 'no profile' results.",
