The reverted App.tsx must use simple, direct profile detection and routing logic — not the tri-state loading system — that was in place when the app was last confirmed working. Remove the tri-state ('loading'/'has-profile'/'no-profile') pattern that caused the app to get stuck on the loading screen indefinitely.",
