The hook must remain in a 'loading' state (isLoading: true, data: undefined) while the actor is undefined or null, and only transition to a settled state (isLoading: false) after the async call has fully resolved. It must never return a null/empty profile result before the backend call has actually completed.",

Phase 2 — once the query has settled, if a profile exists navigate to the Dashboard; if no profile exists navigate to ProfileSetup. Do NOT use a tri-state enum pattern. Do NOT make any routing decision (render ProfileSetup or Dashboard) until both conditions are true: actor is non-null AND isLoading is false.",
