The app must not render ProfileSetup or make any routing decision until BOTH the actor is fully initialized AND the profile query has completed (i.e., is no longer in a loading/pending state). Introduce an explicit tri-state: 'loading' (actor not ready OR query in flight), 'has-profile' (query resolved with a profile), 'no-profile' (query resolved with null/empty). Only navigate to ProfileSetup when state is definitively 'no-profile'. Show a full-screen loading indicator during the 'loading' state.",
