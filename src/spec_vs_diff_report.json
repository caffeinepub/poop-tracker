  "summary": "The implementation successfully covers most requirements for the lifetime leaderboard and statistics. All backend and frontend components are present, including the new getRankedUserStats query, Leaderboard component with King Pooper/King Wiper/MVP badges, and AllTimeStandings table with all required metrics. However, there is a calculation error in the TP rolls formula in the backend that deviates from the specification.",

      "description": "Backend uses incorrect toilet paper roll calculation formula: totalWipes / 10 instead of the specified formula (total wipes × 3 sheets per wipe) ÷ 200 sheets per roll",
      "reason": "REQ-10 explicitly specifies the formula: (total wipes × sheets per wipe) ÷ sheets per roll with defaults of 3 sheets per wipe and 200 sheets per roll. The backend implementation in main.mo uses totalRolls = totalWipes / 10 which equals (totalWipes × 1) / 10, not (totalWipes × 3) / 200. While 3/200 approximately equals 0.015 and 1/10 = 0.1 are similar orders of magnitude, they produce different results (the backend formula gives approximately 6.67x higher values).",
